# PlatoLegionsBot (UNFINISHED)
This Project I started to make a bot for Plato's game Legion. 

TODO:
- Add Backtracking to Bot. The Bot should find the next best move, but does currently not go deeper than one Layer. 
- Add special features to each Card
- Add user interface (currently only usable for programmers)

Feel free to use this code for anything you want.
